      <h2 id="how-prompts-work">How Prompts Work</h2>

<p>In Chippr-AGI, prompts are used by systems to request information or actions to be taken. A system will use a prompt to generate a natural language query, which is then sent to a language model such as GPT-4. The language model processes the query and returns a response, which the system can then interpret and use to update the application state or create new events, components, and entities.</p>

<h2 id="prompts-and-events">Prompts and Events</h2>

<p>Prompts can be used to create events within the application. When a system receives a response from a language model, it can use the information to generate events that will trigger actions or updates within the ECS architecture. For example, a system might use a prompt to request the creation of a new entity, and the language model’s response might provide the necessary information to create an event that will initialize the new entity and its components.</p>

<h2 id="prompts-and-components">Prompts and Components</h2>

<p>Prompts can also be used to create or update components within the application. When a system needs to update the state of a component, it can use a prompt to request the necessary information from a language model. The response can then be used to update the component’s data, which might trigger an update in the system that manages the component. This allows systems to adapt and respond to changes in the environment or user requirements dynamically.</p>

<h2 id="prompts-and-entities">Prompts and Entities</h2>

<p>Prompts can play a vital role in the creation and management of entities within the ECS architecture. Systems can use prompts to request information about new entities or updates to existing entities, and the language model’s response can be used to create or modify the entities and their components. By using prompts, systems can create a dynamic and adaptable application that can respond to changes in the environment or user requirements in real-time.</p>

<p>In summary, prompts are a powerful tool within Chippr-AGI that enables systems to interact with the outside world and adapt to changes in the environment or user requirements. By using prompts, systems can create events, components, and entities based on the responses from language models, allowing for a flexible and dynamic application structure.</p>
