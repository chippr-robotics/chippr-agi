        <td class="title">Entity Component System (ECS) is an architectural pattern widely used in game development and other software systems that require managing a large number of objects with varying properties and behaviors. It promotes flexibility, modularity, and separation of concerns by organizing code into three main categories: Entities, Components, and Systems.</td>
