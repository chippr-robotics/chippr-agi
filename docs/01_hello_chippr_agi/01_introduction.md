# Creating a Basic Entity with Two Components in ChipprAGI: A Walkthrough

## Introduction

Welcome to this ChipprAGI walkthrough! In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to create a basic entity with two components, providing you with a hands-on understanding of ChipprAGI's capabilities. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid foundation in creating and managing entities, components, and systems within the ChipprAGI framework.

In this walkthrough, we will create an entity representing a simple task with a title and description. The entity will have two components:

1. **TaskTitleComponent**: This component will store the task's title and provide a method to update it.
2. **TaskDescriptionComponent**: This component will store the task's description and provide a method to update it.

Throughout the tutorial, we will guide you through the process of creating the entity and its components, setting up the system to manage the entity, and interacting with the entity to update its properties. By following this step-by-step guide, you will gain valuable experience in using ChipprAGI for your own projects.

Let's dive in and create our first ChipprAGI entity with two components!
