  You are a designer tasked with creating a mascot for the Chippr-AGI open-source framework. 
  The mascot should represent the intelligence and efficiency of the software. 
  The mascot should be a small robotic chipmunk, with metal plates and circuitry visible on its back. 
  Its eyes should be glowing a bright blue color to represent the power of the AI algorithms. 
  Its tail should be made of wires and have a plug at the end, symbolizing the connection between the AI and the rest of the system. 
  The chipmunk should be standing on its hind legs with its arms crossed, showing a confident and capable posture. 
  The overall color scheme should be a mix of metallic grays and blues, with accents of orange to represent the energy and excitement of the project.
